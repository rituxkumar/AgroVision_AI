# 🌱 AgroVision AI – Team Project Overview

## 📌 Project Title

**AgroVision AI – AI Based Crop Disease Detection System (Web + Mobile)**

## 🎯 Project Objective

To develop an AI powered platform that helps farmers detect crop diseases using leaf images and provides proper treatment suggestions through:

* Web Application (React)
* Mobile App (React Native)
* AI Backend (Flask + TensorFlow)
* Database (MongoDB)

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Farmers face these issues:

* Unable to identify disease at early stage
* Wrong pesticide usage
* Lack of expert availability
* No proper digital guidance

Our system will solve this using Image Processing & Machine Learning.
